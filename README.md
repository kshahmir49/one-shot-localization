## Abstract
The use of Internet of Things (IoT) in environment monitoring has led to the
development of Smart Environmental Monitoring (SEM) paradigm. Target
or source localization, that determines the underlying cause of environmen-
tal occurrences, is an important aspect of SEM. To prevent an environmen-
tal event in becoming a potential disaster, swift and early localization of
its source is crucial. Target localization is performed with the help of IoT
sensors, which are typically deployed in hazardous environments and are
not easily serviceable, making energy efficiency a requirement for SEM sys-
tems. Furthermore, IoT sensors may provide anomalous readings due to low
battery, low sensor sensitivity, faults, or malicious attacks. This alters the
decision-making process and leads to inaccurate localization of the source.
Hence, detecting and dealing with anomalies, while utilizing a limited number
of sensor nodes, are key factors in addressing reliability and energy efficiency
issues. The current works are iterative in nature, employs redundant nodes,
do not efficiently address anomalous readings, which leads to slow and im-
precise localization, while increasing energy consumption. Moreover, they
are application specific, making them less adaptable to other sensing tasks.
Therefore, this work proposes a comprehensive and novel deep learning-based
system that- (a) repopulates missing data from inactive sensors, (b) detects
and rectifies anomalous data, and (c) instantly localizes a target. The efficacy
of the proposed approach is validated in a radioactive environment and com-
pared to existing benchmark. The results show that the proposed approach
achieves precise, rapid, and efficient localization by achieving 5 times better
accuracy, 50 times faster speeds, and 3 times lesser energy consumption.
